Last Mile Now is a non-profit organization that provides free, on-demand, accessible services to low-income individuals and families. We are a group of students from the Staples High Schools who are passionate about using technology to help those in need.

## Our Mission

We believe that everyone should have access to the same opportunities. We are committed to use technologies such as AI, chatbot and text messages to provide a platform for services in areas such as healthcare, education, and employment. We are currently working on our first pilot program in the Fairfield County area.
