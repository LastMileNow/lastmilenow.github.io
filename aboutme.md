Last Mile Now is a non-profit organization that provides free, on-demand, same-day delivery services to low-income individuals and families. We are a group of students from the Staples High Schools who are passionate about using technology to help those in need.

## Our Mission

We believe that everyone should have access to the same opportunities. We are committed to providing free, on-demand, same-day delivery services to low-income individuals and families. We are also committed to providing a platform for our volunteers to learn about the challenges of poverty and to develop their leadership skills.
