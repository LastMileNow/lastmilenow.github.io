## What we do
Chatbots can help climate change in a number of ways, including:

- Raising awareness about climate change. Chatbots can be used to educate people about the causes and effects of climate change, and to encourage them to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.
- Helping people reduce their carbon footprint. Chatbots can provide people with tips and advice on how to reduce their energy consumption, waste production, and transportation emissions.
- Connecting people with climate change organizations. Chatbots can help people find and connect with climate change organizations that are working to address the issue.
- Advocating for climate change policies. Chatbots can be used to advocate for climate change policies at the local, state, national, and international levels.

Here are some specific examples of how chatbots are being used to help climate change:

- The Climate Action Tracker is a scientific analysis that tracks government climate action and measures it against the globally agreed Paris Agreement goals. They have a chatbot that can provide information about climate change and how to take action.
- The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a tool that helps people calculate their carbon footprint. They have a chatbot that can help people understand their carbon footprint and how to reduce it.
- The 350.org chatbot is a tool that helps people connect with climate change activists and learn about opportunities to get involved in climate change activism.

These are just a few examples of how chatbots can be used to help climate change. As chatbot technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and effective ways to use chatbots to address the climate crisis.

In addition to the above, here are some other ways that chatbots can be used to help climate change:

- Help people find and support sustainable businesses. Chatbots can provide people with information about sustainable businesses in their area, and make it easy for them to support these businesses.
- Help people learn about renewable energy options. Chatbots can provide people with information about renewable energy options, such as solar and wind power, and help them to transition to renewable energy sources.
- Help people reduce their food waste. Chatbots can provide people with tips and advice on how to reduce their food waste, such as meal planning and composting.

Chatbots have the potential to be a valuable tool for addressing climate change. By raising awareness, helping people take action, and connecting people with resources, chatbots can help us to create a more sustainable future.
