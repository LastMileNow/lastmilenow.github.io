This is because our brains associate familiar voices with positive experiences and emotions, and as a result, we are more likely to feel a sense of trust and comfort when hearing them. Additionally, familiarity with a person's voice can also improve our ability to understand and process the information they are communicating, which can lead to more effective and efficient communication.
