"Last Mile Now" uses chatbot and text messaging technologies to improve access to healthcare for low-income individuals and communities. By leveraging these tools, the organization is able to connect individuals with healthcare resources and information in real-time, making it easier for people to access the care they need. Additionally, the use of chatbots and text messaging helps to reduce the complexity of the healthcare system, making it more user-friendly and accessible for those who may not have access to other forms of technology. The use of chatbots also allows "Last Mile Now" to reach a wider audience, including those who may not have access to the internet or a computer.
