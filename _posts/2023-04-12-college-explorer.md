We released [College Explorer](https://college-explorer.streamlit.app/), a website that helps students find the right college for them. It is a free, on-demand, accessible service that provides students with information about colleges and universities, such as tuition, acceptance rates, student demographics and the salary by majors. 

We plan to expand on this project by adding more features, such as a chatbot that can answer students' questions about college admissions and financial aid, and a personalized voice that can help students feel more comfortable and confident when interacting with the chatbot.
